Git import test.

Doesn't work, loses all repo changes (MWAH!):
    The method described here seems quite simple and has worked for me:https://help.github.com/articles/importing-an-external-git-repository

    You can import directly from a local clone.

    cd ~/src/clone_of_repo_to_import
    git push --mirror https://github.com/username/repo_to_import_into
    Enter authentication details if needed. That's all. Now clone or pull into clone of repo_to_import_into and each directory is there..

    If you want all imported into a single top directory then move them into desired position in original repo before you do the import. e.g.

    cd ~/src/clone_of_repo_to_import
    mkdir topDir
    git add topDir
    git mv this that and the other topDir/
    git commit -m"move things into topDir in preparation for exporting into new repo"
    git push --mirror https://github.com/username/repo_to_import_into
