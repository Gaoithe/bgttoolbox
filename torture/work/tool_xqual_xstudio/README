It was trivial to modify the XQual XStudio launcher for perl to work for tcl (ActiveTcl).
It is working for very simple  tcl scripts with ActiveTcl 8.5 (and with modification with 8.4).

Change the perl CLauncherImpl.java thusly:
  s/perl/tcl/gi; s/\.pl/\.tcl/g;
Tcl interpreter: C:/Tcl/bin/tclsh85.exe

It implements the same test interface as XStudio perl (and other):
 * Test generates log.txt with lines including [Success] or [Failure] or [Log]. 
 * Test is deemed complete when a file test_completed.txt is created.

Note for XQual XStudio:
 * source code for test launchers is provided in XAgent and XStudio dir trees. 
 * there doesn't seem to be a Developers Guide though it is referred to  (there are javadocs)
 * a launcher has 4 files (e.g. for tcl) tcl.jar and tcl.xml in launchers/, tcl/CLauncherImpl.java and buildTclLauncher.bat in src/*/ and build/

I've been evaluating using XQual XStudio as a test invoking tool. As opposed to Salome_tmf.
