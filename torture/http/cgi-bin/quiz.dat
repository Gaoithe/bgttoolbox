#there are two choices for this percent and points.  This just specifies
#how the script desides which of the outcomes to print out from the 
#results section of this file.  If you choose percent, please
#put the ranges like 0-20%=Print this if score falls in this range
#If you choose points, put the ranges like this
#0-20=Print this if the total score adds up between 0 and 20 points
#If you dont understand what I am trying to say, look at the
#results section and just try some stuff till it acts like you think 
#it should.
gradeby=percent

#questions and answers
#here is where you specify the questions and answers.  The format
#should be self explanatory.  Q=question? for the question and
#A=Answer=number of points that answer is worth.
#If you fill it up with 5 points for each correct answer and 0 points
#for all incorrecet answers, it woudl work just like a school test.
#If you have different values for each answer, it would work just
#like those quizes in Cozmo and other magazines.

A=No=0

A=Yes=5
A=No=0


#results section
#Here you give the user a description of their personality type or how they 
#performed on the test based on the percentage of points that they earned 
#toward the total.  This is like the section in Cozmo magazine where it tells
#you how the results of their silly quizs will effect the rest of your life :)
