The technique works best when it is based on a    collaborative effort between two parties, thus ensuring participation and commitment to    the project.   5  B  All effort on a project starts from the project plan, which details the work that must be    accomplished.   6  D  Decomposition is the process of subdividing major project deliverables into smaller,    more manageable parts until the deliverables are defined in enough detail to support    future project activities.   7  B  Work packages should not exceed 80 hours because they must be small enough to    permit realistic estimates of cost, time and resources and to simplify control.   8  C  The project manager must be vigilant in ensuring that those stakeholders who support    the effort continue to do so and that those who do not are persuaded to do so, if    possible. In either case, the project manager must take quick action to ensure that the    project's objectives will be met and that a plan is in place to mitigate the influence and    actions of negative stakeholders.   9  D  Because no format exists for change requests, they can occur in many forms.   10  B  The end is reached when either the project's objectives have been achieved or they    are recognised as being unachievable and the project is terminated. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 17   11  D  Interface management entails managing the problems that tend to occur among    departments and disciplines rather than among individuals. It is not primarily concerned    with technical issues.   12  C  The project manager's ability to influence project decisions increases the higher up he    or she - and the person to whom he or she reports - is placed in the organisation.   13  D  The product description documents the characteristics of the product or service that    the project was undertaken to create; the strategic plan sets forth the performing    organisation's strategic goals; the project selection criteria generally cover management   concerns, such as financial return; and the historical data consist of information on    previous project selection decisions and performance.   14  B  This PMBOK term is used to describe the unique identifiers for each element in the    WBS. In almost all cases, the unique identifier uses a scheme that clearly describes the    relationship of the individual WBS element to the level above it.   15  A  Work authorization systems is one of the formal Tools & Techniques used in Project    Plan Execution to make certain that work is done when it is supposed to be. Although    this often requires written authorization, on smaller projects verbal authorizations could    be deemed adequate.      Scope verification involves acquiring formal acceptance of the project scope, and is not   related to the authorization of work packages.      Both Performance Reporting and Information Distribution are Project Communication    Management processes, and as such are for reporting and informing, not authorizing.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.47, 61,118 .    16   C  Customers expect their problems to be alleviated, not compounded. They want positive    results and expect things to run smoothly and according to plan. However, they must    separate wants from needs and be willing to make compromises.   17  C  The scope statement provides stakeholders with a common understanding of the scope    of the project and is a source of reference for making future project decisions.   18  B  All assumptions and constraints regarding the project must be documented because the    scope statement provides the basis for making future project decisions.   19  A  Used when projects are complex, involving cross-functional efforts, the matrix    structure is a staple of functional and projectised organisations. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 18   20  D  The Project Scope Management knowledge area consists of 5 processes: Initiation,    Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Scope Verification, and Scope Change Control. The    Initiation process is the core process of the Initiating Processes. Scope Planning and    Scope Definition are core processes in the Planning Processes. And, Scope    Verification and Scope Change Control are facilitating processes under the Controlling    Processes group.      Please note that this may appear differently in pre-2000 project management literature.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.32-37.     21   D  In order to prepare the Scope Statement and Scope Management Plan, as well as any    supporting detail, it is important to understand the product to be produced by the    project. A better understanding of the product comes through carrying out a Product    Analysis, part of Scope Planning, which may look at various aspects of the product,    such as subcomponents, engineering, cost, and function.      Inspection is the only formal tool/technique of Scope Verification. Initiation simply uses    project selection techniques and expert judgment to produce its outputs. Finally,    Quality Control utilizes inspection, control charts, Pareto diagrams, statistical sampling,    flowcharts, and trend analysis in its set of Tools and Techniques.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.52,96.   22  A  The Scope Statement includes project objectives, deliverables and project justification. It    does not include the project plan, rather, it is an input into developing the Project Plan.    Put another way, the project plan comes AFTER (and uses) the scope statement.      PMBOK 2000, Project Scope Management, Chapter 5    23   A  The WBS, or Work Breakdown Structure, is an output from the Scope Definition    process and an input to the Scope Verification process, which is one of the facilitating    Controlling Processes.      The Scope Management Plan is an output from the Scope Planning process, not the    Scope Definition process.      The Activity List is an output of the Activity Definition process.      The Project Charter is an output of the Initiation process.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.36,52,66. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 19   24  C  The project charter gives the project manager the authority to use the organization's    resources for the project.      A Work Breakdown Structure, or WBS, generally is developed further along in the    project.      Formal acceptance of a deliverable comes at the end of a project or project phase, not    at the beginning.      A relaxing trip... well, that would be nice, but we aren't talking about that kind of charter   here!      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.52,54,148.   25  C  Scope Planning and Definition leads to development of the WBS. Put another way,    Scope Planning comes BEFORE (and is the basis for developing) the WBS.      PMBOK 2000, Project Scope Management, Chapter 5 and PMI Practice Standard for    WBS 2001   26  A  The project charter formally recognises the project and gives authority to the project    manager to assign resources to it. Management decided on the amount of authority    given to the project manager and the functional managers who will be involved in the    project.   27  A  The code of accounts assigns a unique number to each WBS element.      A chart of accounts, however, applies to cost accounting and is used to categorize    costs. The corporate chart of accounts usually is used as the basis for the project    chart of accounts.      The WBS dictionary consists of planning information, such as work package    descriptions, staffing assignments, schedule dates, and budgets.      A PBS is basically the same as a WBS. However, in some organizations the term WBS    is used incorrectly to mean a BOM (Bill of Materials); in these cases the organization    may use the term PBS instead of WBS.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.61,198-199.   28  D  Management by objectives focuses on the goals of an activity rather than the activity    itself so that managers are held responsible for obtaining results rather than performing    certain activities. These results can be used as yardsticks in evaluating project    performance. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 20   29  B  The Initiating Processes group has a single formal process, Initiation.      The others have more than one - Controlling, 8 (2 core + 6 facilitating), Executing, 7 (1    core + 6 facilitating), and Closing, 2 core processes only.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.32,35,36,37.     30  A  A task is a project's lowest level of effort and is not in the WBS.      An activity can be broken down further into tasks, and so these two terms would not    be synonymous.      A work package, unlike a task, is in the WBS, at its lowest level. Again, the two terms    are not the same.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.197,209.   31  A  Value engineering can be used along with life-cycle costing to reduce life-cycle costs    and schedule, while augmenting profits, performance, and quality, as well as yielding    other advantages.      A benefit/cost analysis compares estimates of what will have to be put into the project    (costs) with what will be derived from the project (benefits) for each of the alternatives    under consideration. This is a direct aid only in the initial decision-making process.      Decomposition involves breaking down the project deliverables so as to be able to    produce a WBS, or work breakdown structure.      PDM stands for Precedence Diagramming Method, one of the Tools & Techniques used    during the Activity Sequencing process.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.56,58,66,83,209.    32   A  During scope verification, work results and deliverables are reviewed for correctness.         Information Distribution and Performance Reporting are under Project Communications   Management and involve the distribution of information to project stakeholders, the latter    process focused more on how project objectives are being met.      Quality Assurance deals more with confidence in the project's satisfying quality    standards.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.61,101,118. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 21   33  D  The Scope Statement, an output from Scope Planning, is used during Scope Definition to    break down the project into more manageable parts/tasks, called the Work Breakdown    Structure, or WBS.      The WBS then is an input for the Activity Definition process to produce an Activity List.      Much more detail than just the WBS is required at the point of developing a project    schedule, and thus the WBS isn't even a direct input for Schedule Development.      PMBOK(R) Guide 2000 Edition, pp.52,66.     34  D  A configuration control board is established on many projects to represent all interested    parties and to process, analyse and improve or reject all requests for change.    35   C  The scope management plan is an output of scope planning, not scope definition.   36  C  The WBS provides input to the scheduling process, but is not a scheduling method such    as PERT.   37  D  Organisational problems, such as separation of responsibility and authority, can hinder    the work being done and lead to poor quality; poorly identified customer needs and    inadequately specified product requirements can result in a product that is unusable or    grossly underused; and poor planning and control can create a chaotic environment    and poor project results.   38  B  Completion of product scope is measured against the requirements; completion of    project scope is measured against the project plan. Both processes ensure that the    work of the project will result in delivery of the specified product.   39  C  Any significant change in the project scope, direction, or methodology will require    changes to the project plan.   40  A  The greatest degree of uncertainty about the future is encountered during the concept    phase. The direction of the project is determined in this phase, and the decisions made    have the greatest influence on scope, quality, time and cost of the project.   41  D  The output from scope verification is documentation that the customer has accepted the    project product.   42  B  To develop the project plan, needs are formulated as functional requirements. Technical    requirements emerge from the functional requirements because the latter generally do    not offer enough precise guidance to project staff. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 22   43  D  A review of the role of the control system may be conducted at any time. Therefore,    such reviews, if conducted at all, are rarely mentioned in any documentation.   44  B  The model should reflect the objectives of the company and its managers; consider the    realities of the organisation's limitations on facilities, capital and personnel; and include    factors for risk - the technical risks of performance, cost, and time and the market risk    of customer rejection.     45  A  The project manager must be attentive to both regulation (achievement) and    conservation. In the conservation role, he or she must guard the physical assets of the    organisation -its human and financial resources.   46  A  A work package is the lowest or smallest unit of work division in a project of WBS.    Typically, a work package contains about 80 hours of work.   47  A  The project plan is a key input to overall change control.   48  B  Customer satisfaction, not time or cost, is the primary criterion for measuring project    success.   49  C  A project will be unique even with repetitive elements. A hotel being constructed won't    be the first one and many of the components (e.g. rooms) will be almost identical but    the uniqueness may come from location, use of newer materials, people used to    perform the work, etc.      The other answers are true.      A project delivers its objective and completes while an operation has the ongoing    objective of sustaining the business      PMBOK 2000, The Project Management Context, Chapter 2 Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 23   50  A  Feasibility is an optional stage or phase where the project is shaped, strategy    determined and approval given to proceed with the project. It is still part of the project    (stage 1) and there should be approval to conduct the feasibility. There may be checks    at various stages to decide if the project should proceed into subsequent stages.      The others are all false.      All projects, by their unique nature, are uncertain.      The probability of success generally improves (and therefore risk decreases) as the    project advances and more of the unknown at the beginning becomes    known/completed.      A project is a temporary endeavor to produce those goods &/or services and    completes upon accomplishing that objective. A different, support and maintenance,    structure takes over to carry out ongoing operation of those project deliverables.      PMBOK 2000, The Project Management Context, Chapter 2     51  A  You need to determine the project scope before you can do any of the other activities    listed in the answers.      Once the scope is planned you can produce a WBS (a detailed decomposition of that    scope). Until you know what you are doing (via at least the scope, if not the WBS) you    will not know what project team you will need. You also cannot do any assessment of    costs and benefits if you have not defined your scope.      PMBOK 2000, (The Project Management Framework) Introduction, Chapter 1   52  A  As part of Initiation within Project Scope Management, PMBOK offers two types of    project selection tool/techniques:      1) Benefit measurement methods   2) Constrained optimization methods      Economic models fall under the benefit measurement category whereas the other three    answers are examples of constrained optimization methods.      In general, benefit measurement methods involve scoring and comparing projects on a    financial basis. Constrained optimization involves mathematical modeling around various   project selection criteria (which may include financial) to help in selecting which    projects should go ahead/be initiated.      PMBOK 2000, Project Scope Management, Chapter 5 Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 24   53  C  The project charter formally authorizes a project. It is usually issued by senior    management and gives the PM authority to obtain resources for the project. It is the key    output from Initiation.      PMBOK 2000, Project Scope Management, Chapter 5   54  A  A system is needed for careful monitoring of changes made to the requirements. Use of   written exchange orders encourages the individuals asking for changes to take    responsibility for their requests and reduces frivolous requests that may adversely    affect the project.   55  D  A deliverable is an outcome or item that is produced as part of a project. Deliverables    should be measurable, tangible, and verifiable. For example, reports, designs, and    products are all deliverables. It is important to describe deliverables well so project    teams know what they are supposed to produce.      PMBOK Guide, 2000, p. 200.     56  C  The 5 groups of project management processes are:      Initiating   Planning   Executing   Controlling   Closing      PMBOK Chapter 2 clearly shows which processes fall into each group and is worth    reviewing well.      Scope verification, scope change control and performance reporting all fall under    Controlling while contract administration (part of Procurement) is an Executing process.      PMBOK 2000, Project Management Processes, Chapter 3   57  C  This document signifies official sanction by top management and starts the planning, or    development, phase. The project charter formally recognises the existence of the    project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organisational    resources to project activities.   58  D  Multi-objective programming uses a mathematical programming model and is categorised    as a constrained optimisation method. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 25   59  C  Project performance is measured against the baseline plan, which is the original,    approved project plan plus or minus later approved changes. A WBS is a work    breakdown structure, an important tool in scope management. A scope statement is    also an important tool in scope management. The term performance plan is not a    common term used in project management.   60  C  Decomposition means breaking down deliverables into smaller components. A WBS    dictionary describes each WBS item in detail. Expert judgment and historical information    help in developing a WBS. However, they do not have to focus on a top-down    approach to defining a project's scope.      PMBOK Guide, 2000, p. 58.   61  A  Money today is worth more than money several years from now. A discount factor is    applied to determine what future cash flows are worth in today's dollar. Therefore,    after applying a discount factor each year to annual cash flows for a project, the net    present value will be lower than the total cash flow estimate. Net present value    provides a means to compare financial values of multi-year projects in a consistent    manner.   62    C  A project charter is a key output of initiating. It is a document for formally recognizing    the existence of a project. Other outputs of initiating include assigning a project    manager and identifying project constraints and assumptions.      PMBOK Guide, 2000, p. 52   63  C  The cost account matrix is a one-page chart or conversion table that relates the    functional organisations to the WBS elements. It lists the WBS elements horizontally    across the top and the functional departments vertically in the left column. An X is    placed where each organisation has work to do in the WBS element. The cost account    matrix provides a useful summary of the work contained in the WBS dictionary.    64   A  Scope creep is the tendency for project scope to grow for a variety of reasons. On    technical projects, scope can creep as new technologies become available. Sometimes    users or customers learn about new possibilities, so they ask for more work, meaning    scope creep. People also often underestimate or forget about important work required    for a project, which can result in scope creep.   65  C  The project charter should be issued by a manager outside the project but a level    appropriate to the project's needs. Because it provides the project manager with the    authority to apply organisational resources to project activities, the project charter    should not be issued by the project manager. Functional managers should have    approved authority. Sample Questions: Scope                                                                                                                 Page 26   66  B  A WBS is a hierarchical grouping of project work. By definition, each level is a larger    segment of the level below. A WBS is often created by focusing on deliverables or    products, not time. A WBS can be organized by project phases, but it does not have to    be organized that way. A WBS can be a guide for developing the project budget, but it    does not have to be.   67  D  The criteria for determining project success should be included in scope planning.    Scope planning also includes developing a scope statement and scope management    plan. Scope definition and verification are done after scope planning. Initiation results in    a project charter and should be done before scope planning.     68  D  Most organizations define a successful project as one that met scope, time, and cost    goals. The Standish Group is well-known for their studies of project success rates.    Their criteria for success is based on meeting scope, time, and cost goals. Other    organizations also include the criteria of satisfying the project's sponsor in order to be a   successful project. Each project can include its own criteria for determining success    by documenting it during scope planning.   69  B  Multi-objective programming algorithms, such as linear programming, are constrained    optimization methods. These methods can be used to aid in project selection. Net    present value, return on investment, and payback analysis are financial analysis tools    that also aid in project selection.      PMBOK Guide, 2000, p. 54.   70  A  Scope verification focuses on the acceptance of work. Quality control focuses on the    correctness of the work. Scope definition results in creation of a WBS. Initiation results    in creation of a project charter.      PMBOK Guide, 2000, p. 61
