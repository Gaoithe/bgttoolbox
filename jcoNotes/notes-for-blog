notes on how to run cron and locatedb windows


Also cruise control was gebrokened (after windows update reboot it was not started).

I had accessed it one day before it went broken so I thought I was doing something wrong. Quick google shows on windows JavaService wrapper can be used to install it as windows service. Hmmm. I wonder could cygrunsrv do that.

2 builds after it is reenabled someone breaks the build! :) Good timing :)


<pre>
$ cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron -a -D
$ cygrunsrv -L
cron

$ net start cron
The cron service is starting.
The cron service was started successfully.

$ cygrunsrv -Q cron
Service             : cron
Current State       : Running
Controls Accepted   : Stop
Command             : /usr/sbin/cron -D

$ crontab -e
44 4 * * * "/cygdrive/c/Documents and
Settings/user/bin"/run_updatedb_intune.sh 2> /dev/null
55 9 * * * echo "james cron test" > /tmp/jamesCronTest.txt
# at 4:44am daily


$ export EDITOR=vi
$ cat ~/bin/run_updatedb_intune.sh
