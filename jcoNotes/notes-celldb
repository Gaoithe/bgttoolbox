When Nulaz installed it didn't show caps at install time, it ASKED at runtime
to allow net services.
Good to do that inside WhereAmI


WhereAmI
how does it decide location of cell?
can it get power of cell?
did it upload cells?

In the phone application, why do I get a popup that asks me to allow network?

Unfortunately phone manufacturers have implemented this as a security measure to prevent people receiving an unexpected high phone bill at the end of the month. With a lot of phones you can configure these security messages.

If you have a Nokia, you should find the Installation Manager. We could prevent these warnings by buying expensive certificates, but prefer to leave the warning in there for unsuspecting users. If you check 'ask first time' it will only happen on startup.

Some phones have been branded in a way that makes it impossible to select a 'only ask first time' option. Please check your settings menu, if you can set it in the permissions for applications. If you can not do this, you should probably unlock your phone.

Why does my Nokia keep asking permission for positioning?

By default the positioning permission is set to 'ask every time'. It is not possible to change this to ask first time from the program, you need to do this from the Application Manager. The application Manager can usually be found in:

Main Menu > Applications > App. Mgr.
Open Nulaz (Installed) > Positioning > Ask First Time.

Now, it will only ask you for permission when launching the application. [Top]

What is Locle?

Locle is an easy, free application that lets you find your friends on your mobile without the need for GPS.

You can access Locle on a mobile phone (http://m.locle.com) or from a PC (http://www.locle.com).

Locle is similar to Bebo, MySpace or Facebook : you can connect with friends and send them messages. But Locle does more: it lets you discover where your friends are. The thing about Locle is that you share your location only with people you have selected. And of course, if you don’t want friends to find you, you can temporarily disable it until you’re feeling more sociable.
