Thanks very much for the freelancing article, ... I can call over and give it to you if you like?

The article you gave to me mentions these sites:
http://guru.com
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru.com
http://elance.com
http://rentacoder.com
http://getafreelancer.com
Each person says they use the sites to get new contacts with employers and after a time work more directly with
the employers.

also mentioned:  odesk
Robert O'Shaughnessy, web designer, 28, travelling world

I can't find the article online.


I've had a look at guru.com and rentacoder.com now a bit.
I read through guru.com's process and terms - seems good but you do really have to watch out for yourself.
On guru.com the vast majority of jobs advertised are from unrated employers - possibly most people bypass guru.com for the
payment side. Starting out you would probably try go through a rated employer. Very interesting selection of work though.
On rentacoder.com you could find out a bit more about the projects without having a paid account.
