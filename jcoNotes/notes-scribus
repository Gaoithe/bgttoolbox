Make it easier to convert whole document from A4 to A5 would be nice.
Use document settings and change to A5.
But then need to manually select all on page (click on page and ctrl-A) 
and resize.
 Would be very useful: 
  Command to select all on each page and fit/scale into page.
 Command to fix errors on page where stuff go outside page would be nice. 

Resized to A5 and margins 40 40 40 40 stayed same.
 In view don't see that you'r eusing margins.

Resized to A5, then resized pages manually (difficult, move and  snap to grid/guidelines, but quite  manual). Then PDF generation has artifacts from adjoining pages, I think where a page goes outside it's own border or margin.

Import in PDF/image good.
Someone sent an image in word doc :-7
Could print to image writer and printed greyscale tiff, then converted to jpeg.


Editing text is painful.
In-situ or in text editor.
Ctrl-I to italicize and other shortcuts would be nice.


Flow of content from page to page would be nice.


Adds coming in now and being added.
TODO: last few bios, all mugshots, get pictures right (caption etc also)

Maeve wanted a job (at about 7:45 (past time for bed) so I asked would she like a financial position, an engineering job, ... We fired up kturtle and discovered foreward <n> (fw <n>), turnleft/turnright <n degrees> (tl/tr <n>). She liked typing in the commands.

maeve_1.turtle

kturtle-script-v1.0
@(forward) 2
@(tl) 90
@(fw) 100
@(tl) 90
@(fw) 100
@(fw) 10
@(fw) 100
@(tr) 90
@(tr) 100

THEN we discovered with a clear at the end of a sequence of moves that it's real easy to make spiral patterns! Adding a space after commands wasn't intuitive.
Kate joined in and was quite adventurous "pencolor 234444432,333" "fw 1110".

#clear
@(pencolor) 0@(,)255@(,)0
@(forward) 27
@(tl) 90
@(fw) 100
@(tl) 90
@(fw) 100
@(tl) 33
@(fw) 10
@(tr) 77
@(fw) 100
@(tr) 90
@(fw) 10
@(tr) 100
@(fw) 100
@(center)

Past bedtime! Maeve gets ready herself completely. Then we make a repeat 675 loop to run Kate's sequence while she gets ready for bed. 

kate_and_maeve_turt_wheel3.turtle

#clear 
pencolor 255,255,0
repeat 675 {
forward 27
tl 90
fw 100

fw 100
tl 33
fw 10
tr 66
fw 1110

center
}

Read Maeve's story which is mixed-up fairy tales. Then Kate's from library.
