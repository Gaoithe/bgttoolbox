Hello Alistair,

How are you keeping? 

I got laid off from where I was working, finished up end of Feb - CommProve - Italian company - mobile network QoS software.  So I'm updating LinkedIn/CV and looking around for jobs.

We got 2 chickens!
They're keeping us very amused and a bit busy too :)

James.



Hello Simon :)

Some LinkedIn/website introductions can be very impersonal and I try to make up for that :-P :)  How are you guys keeping? Good I hope and enjoying some Spring sunshine like us.  Our mostest excitingest news is that we got 2 chickens who are lovely pets. :)
