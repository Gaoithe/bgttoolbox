Hello, 

 We got a nice package in the post from you today.
 And we got chickens yesterday (more on that below).


 I could open your photoshop file okay. 
 Open source and the gimp (free alternative program to photoshop) wins! :)
 The gimp works on windows too.
 If you don't have photoshop at home you could get it.
  http://www.gimp.org/windows/

 Your file is quite big alright - your photoshop file is 340M.
  340M isn't completely ridiculous - close - but not totally unmanegable.
  340M would take maybe 8750secs (assuming 40kb/s good broadband) = 2+ hours
   to send or download anywhere

 Probably it is so big as you have enough resolution to print it bigger.
 If you save it as jpeg at a fixed printing size you get rid of the 
 extra resolution and you get a smaller file. 
 I have saved it as a 5.6M jpeg which should print out on A4 okay and 
  a Thumb for viewing. I have put them on the dspsrv. 
 You can look at them there and right-click and select Save As ...

 The .jpg there is original resolution you sent 1600x1600 pixels = 200x200mm
 It is 5.6M in file size.
  5.6M at 40kb/s would take maybe 2 minutes to transfer somewhere
 The Thumb is much smaller 50x50mm = 544k (= 0.5M)
 If you printed the Thumb full size (A4) it would probably look blurry.

 A normal sized photo could be from .5M to 4M in size (depending on resolution).
 The higher the resolution the bigger the size and the bigger you can print it.
 
 Too much info probably.
 We need a diagram.
  We need several diagrams.

 
 We got 2 chickens yesterday and we've been busy today finishing a chicken coop.
 Check Facebook for some pics.
 Hopefully they will survive the night tonight! :) 
 They were inside in a cardboard box last night.
 They're quite feisty, it was windy blowy so a bit unsettling weather to be arriving at a new home.
 Settling in alright to coop and garden.
 The darker one is adopted by Kate - Rosie.
 The lighter and fatter one is adopted by Maeve - Lucy.

gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

And then add:

#silly speaker beep

blacklist pcspkr

Save your file and the speaker beep will be gone when you reboot.

If you don’t want to wait until a reboot, simply type:

sudo rmmod pcspkr


# in System Prefs Sound there is no third tab? PC Speaker  .

in .xinitrc:
xset b off
xset b 0 0 0

# annoying beep off (actually in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc )
xset -b b 0
xset b off
xset b 0 0 0
