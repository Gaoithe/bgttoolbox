 ... stuff happens piecemeal but it happens better if you've a good policy to draw from. Who will read it? Who will use it?

The not free as in beer but free as in speech is difficult to understand.
Open standards mean free from vendor lock-in.

Policy must be fair and generic - not mentioning specific details such as Linux/Windows. But it is really hard for people to understand open source, open standards issues anyway - even without negative propoganda from Microsoft. So concrete examples would be good.

Subject: [ILUG] TOG: A Hackerspace for Dublin
To: ilug at linux.ie


Irish pubs are world renowned for there ability to lubricate and
facilitate a conversation, but they aren't particularly suitable places
for being creative and actually building something.

The solution to this problem is a Hackerspace [1].  Basically a
Hackerspace is a physical place where people can meet and work together
on projects.

All of us have had at least one little project we've wanted to work on,
but haven't had the place, time, knowledge, equipment or money to do it.
A Hackerspace and it's members provide a suitable place and resources
for these and various other projects to be worked on collaboratively.
Whether the project is technical, practical, artistic or a combination,
everything is fair game.

Having talked about this for a while, seen and read about the successful
Hackerspaces [2] around the world.  I'm now working on building a
Hackerspace for Dublin called TOG [3].

If your also interested in helping to build a Hackerspace in Dublin,
join me on Thursday the 29th of January at 7pm in the lobby bar of the
Alexandre Hotel [4] on Fenian Street near the Merrion Square.

Thanks.

Robert Fitzsimons
