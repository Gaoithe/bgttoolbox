 josm editgpx plugin or utilsplugin
1. plugin install is hard and stupid.
  josm from apt has plugins dir writable by root only
    so run josm as root and ... messy
  ALSO josm preferences plugins is bad
  plugins in prefs => update list, add url for plugin list, ... doesn't work?
  get plugins .jar and copy to ~/.josm/plugins/
2. EditGPX plugin, convert to layer, .. doesn't do anything?

GPX layer -> data layer convert does not simplify track
