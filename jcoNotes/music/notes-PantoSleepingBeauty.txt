 "Now I know where I belong..."

Now I know where to go,
I'm not following the crowd
But there's so many faces staring at me.
I'm not going with the flow,
I gotta wave goodbye and say hello,
To unfamiliar circumstances!

Oh oh oh,
I'm gonna start believin' in myself.
It's up to me and no-one else.
I'm feelin'!!

(Chorus)
This could be the start of something,
I can feel my heart is jumping.
Want to walk but can't stop running,
(Oooooo)I can't stop running!
Good to be a part of something,
Once upon a time was nothing.
This could be the start of something,
This could be the start of something good!

Life's a b****, life's a mess!
Try'na find your way it's not so easy,
It's not the way it looks on TV.
I'm fully clothed, but still undressed.
Like I'm walking on the highest wire,
Without a safety net below me!

Oh oh oh oh,
Ain't no other place I'd rather be,
Listen to the voice inside of me,
That's shoutin'!!

(Chorus:)
This could be the start of something,
I can feel my heart is jumping.

Want to walk but can't stop running,
(Oooooo)I can't stop running!
Good to be a part of something,
Once upon a time was nothing.
This could be the start of something,
This could be the start of something good!

Good to be where I belong...
It's just so good to belon-on-on-ong...
Maybe this time is the one. (time is the one)
Maybe this time is the one time I've been waiting for too long!

(Chorus:)
This could be the start of something,
I can feel my heart is jumping!
Want to walk but can't stop running,
(Oooooo)I can't stop running!
Good to be a part of something,

This could be the start of something,
This could be the start of something good!!...

Intro:

[C] [D] [E]

Verse 1:

I [E]met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you [A]drink champagne and it [D]tastes just like
Cherry [E]cola, C - O - L - A [A]cola
She [E]walked up to me and she asked me to dance
And I [A]asked her her name and in a [D]dark brown voice
She said [E]"Lola, L - O - L - A [A]Lola [D]
La la la la [C]Lola" [D] [E]

Verse 2:

Well, [E]I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she [A]squeezed me tight she nearly [D]broke my spine,
Oh, my [E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola
Well, [E]I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she [A]walked like a woman and [D]talked like a man,
Oh, my [E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola, [D]
La la la laÊ[C]Lola. [D] [E]

Well, we [B7]drank champagne and danced all night
[F#m]Under electric candle light
She [A]picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said, "Dear Boy, won't you come home with me?"

Verse 3:

Well, [E]I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I [A]looked in her eyes, well, I [D]almost fell for my

La la la la [C]Lola [D]
[E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola [D]
La la la la [C]Lola [D] [E]

Bridge:


I [A]pushed [E]her a[B7]way
I [A]walked [E]to the [B7]door
I [A]fell [E]to the [B7]floor
I got [A]down [F#m]on my [C#m]knee
ThenÊI [B7]looked at her and she at me

Verse 4:

Well, [E]that's the way that I want it to stay
And I [A]always want it to [D]be that way
For my [E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola
[E]Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a [A]mixed up, muddled up, [D]shook up world except for
[E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola

Well,Ê[B7]I left home just a week before
[F#m]And I'd never kissed a woman before
ButÊ[A]Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said, "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man!"

Verse 5:

Well, [E]I'm not the world`s most masculine man,
But I [A]know what I am and I'm [D]glad I'm a man and so is
[E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola [D]
La la la la [C]Lola [D]
[E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola [D]
La la la la [C]Lola [D] [E]
[E]Lola, la la la la [A]Lola [D]

Joe Dolan You're Such a Good Looking Woman Lyrics:

When God created a woman for me
he must have been in a beautiful mood
to show the world what a woman could be
when he created a woman like you.
He made the sunshine right out of your eyes
he made the moonglow all over your hair
he put a soft summer breeze in your sighs
so you could breath summer into the air.

Up there in heaven I bet the are mad
I bet somebody will want to know why
the most incredible angel they had
was found to be quite unable to fly
[ Find more Lyrics on http://mp3lyrics.org/9Wt ]
D'you know what they had forgotten to do
up there where they make all those heavenly things
they made an angel as lovely as you
but they'd forgotten to fit you with wings.

R E F R A I N :

Oh me oh my you make me sigh
you're such a good looking woman
when people stop and people stare
you know it fills my heart with pride
you watch their eyes they're so surprised
they think you've fallen out of heaven
and if you listen to what they're talking about
they're talking about who's walking about
with an angel at his side.

With A Little Help From My Friends Lyrics
Artist(Band):The Beatles

What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm,I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, get high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, gonna to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm I get high with a little help from my friends,
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Ooh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
with a little help from my friends

GALINDA
(spoken) Elphie - now that we're friends, I've decided to
make you my new project.

ELPHABA
(spoken) You really don't have to do that

GALINDA
(spoken) I know. That's what makes me so nice!
(sung) Whenever I see someone
Less fortunate than I
(And let's face it - who isn't
Less fortunate than I?)
My tender heart
Tends to start to bleed
And when someone needs a makeover
I simply have to take over
I know I know exactly what they need
And even in your case
Tho' it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry - I'm determined to succeed
Follow my lead
And yes, indeed
You will be:

Popular!
You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper ploys
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce
I'll show you what shoes to wear
How to fix your hair
Everything that really counts

To be popular
I'll help you be popular!
You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go:

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to be come a pal, a
Sister and adviser
There's nobody wiser
Not when it comes to popular -
I know about popular
And with an assist from me
To be who you'll bee
Instead of dreary who-you-were: are:
There's nothing that can stop you
From becoming popu-
Ler: lar:

La la la la
We're gonna make
You popular

When I see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own behalf
To think of
Celebrated heads of state or
Specially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh!

They were popular! Please -
It's all about popular!
It's not about aptitude
It's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very very popular
Like me!

(spoken) Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.

ELPHABA(spoken) I - I have to go:

GALINDA
(spoken) You're welcome!
(sung) And though you protest
Your disinterest
I know clandestinely
You're gonna grin and bear it
Your new found popularity
La la la la
You'll be popular -
Just not as quite as popular
As me!

TRACY 
You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill 
You can try to stop the seasons, girl, but you know you never will 
And you can try to stop my dancing feet, but I just cannot stand still! 
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of the sound 
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way 

TRACY & LINK 
'Cause you can't stop the beat 
Ever since this whole world began 
A woman found out if she shook it, she could shake up a man 
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that i can today 
'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky 
You can wonder, if you wanna, but I'll never ask why 
And if you try and hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say 
That you can't stop the beat! 

PENNY 
You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea 
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be! 
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed, I'll call the N double A C P 
Cause the world keeps spinnin round and round 
And my heart's keepin time to the speed of sound 
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way 

PENNY & SEAWEED 
Cause you cant stop the beat! 
Ever since we first saw the light 
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night 
and so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today 
Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean, or the rain from above 
you can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay 
Cause you cant stop the beat! 

EDNA 
You can't stop my happiness, cause I like the way I am 
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas Ham! 
So if you don't like the way I look, well, I just dont give a damn! 
Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
and my hearts keepin time to the speed of sound 
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way 
Cause you cant stop the beat 
Ever since this whole world began 
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man 
and so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today! 
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky 
You can wonder, if you wanna, but I'll never ask why 
And if you try and hold me down, I'm gonna spit in your eye and say 
That you can't stop the beat! 

MOTORMOUTH MAYBELLE 
Oh, Oh, Oh 
You can't stop today [No!] 
As it comes speeding down the track [oooh, child yes!] 
Yesterday is history [be gone!] 
And it's never comin back! [Look ahead, cause...] 
Tomorrow is a brand new day, and it don't know white from black [YEAH!] 
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
And my heart's keepin time to the speed of sound 
I was lost til I heard the drums, then I found my way 
'Cause you cant stop the beat! 
Ever since we first saw the light, 
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night 
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today! 
Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean, or the rain from above 
They can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay 
Cause you can't stop the beat! 

ENSEMBLE 
Aah, aah, aah, 
Ahh, ahh, ahh 
Ahh, ahh, ahh ahh 
Ever since we first saw the sun 
A man and woman like to shake it when the day is done 
And so we're gonna shake and shimmy it and have some fun today! 
Cause you can't stop the Motion of the ocean or the rain from above 
You can try to stop the paradise were dreamin of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay! 

You cant stop the beat! (you cant stop the beat) 
You cant stop the beat! (you cant stop the beat) 
YOU CANT STOP THE BEAT!

I'm So Excited - Pointer Sisters
1982

Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Get in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I let it go

I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know I know I know I know I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last for long long time
We'll have a good time, Baby, don't do worry
And if we're still playin' around boy that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I know I know I know I know I know I want you, I want you

I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I let it go

I'm so excited, I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I know I know I know I know I know I want you

Somewhere Out There
Lyrics as performed by
Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram
from the movie An American Tail (1987)
written by James Horner, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil

Linda:
Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight

james:
Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

Linda:
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Together:
Somewhere out there if love can see us through
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

[musical interlude]

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there if love can see us through
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Hmm, hmm, hmm,...

I wanna see it tainted, tainted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it tainted, tainted, tainted, tainted black
Yeah!

Hmm, hmm, hmm,...

Em  D       G       D       A               B
  I have to turn my head un-til my darkness goes.

Verse 2

Em                         B     
  I see a line of cars and they're all painted black.
Em                              B
  With flowers and by love both never to come back.
Em  D          G          D         Em
  I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
Em       D        G    D       A             B 
  Like a new born baby it just happens every day.

Verse 3

Em                         B
  I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
Em                        B
  I see my red door and I want it painted black.
Em      D         G      D       Em
  Maybe then I'll fade a-way and not have to face the facts.
Em         D    G      D       A                   B
  It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.

Verse 4

Em                             B
  No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue.
Em                              B
  I could not forsee this thing happening to you.
Em   D      G      D        Em
  If I look hard e-nough in-to the setting sun
Em   D         G          D     A                B
  My love will laugh with me be-fore the morning comes.

Let me tell you now

CHORUS:
Oh baby all I need is one more chance

   Bm7
My baby's always dancin'
       D
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
    G
But I don't get no loving
              D
And that's no lie

   Bm7
We spent the night in Frisco
   D
At every kind of disco
    G
And from that night I kissed
             Asus4
Our love goodbye

CHORUS:           D
Don't blame it on sunshine
                  Bbmaj7
Don't blame it on moonlight
                  C
Don't blame it on good times
                D
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

VERSE:
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me
On my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me

CHORUS X 2:
Don't blame it on sunshine

Don't you blame it on sunshine

VERSE:
This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me
Through this dance

I'm full of funky fever
And fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a
Super trance

CHORUS X 2

Owww - sunshine
Whoo - moonlight
Yeah - good times
Mmmm - boogie

You just gotta - sunshine
Yeah - moonlight
Good times
Good times - boogie

Don't you blame it - sunshine
You just gotta - moonlight
You just wanna - goodtimes
Yeah - boogie
Ohh blame it on yourself - sunshine
Ain't nobody's fault - moonlight
But yours and that boogie - goodtimes
On all night long - boogie

Yours and that boogie - sunshine
Ain't nobody's fault - moonlight
But yours and that boogie - goodtimes
Dancin' all night long - boogie

Blame it on yourself - sunshine
Ain't nobody's fault - moonlight
But yours and that funky funky boogie al night long - goodtimes

	Difficulty: intermediate

   ____________________________________
  / KT Tunstall                       /  The meaning of the song is in the
 / I Want You Back (Jackson 5 cover) /  title, simple as it is. This song was
/___________________________________/  Jackson 5's breakthrough single back in
                                      1969, and it was written by some of the
songwriters working for the newly-started record company Motown, on which it was
also released. Motown was the first record company ever to be owned by African
American's and it was therefore obvious that fice black boys were chosen to
front the label. Back then Jackson 5 were still just figurehead for the company
and hadn't really any influence on their career yet. It was all yet a concept
band just the way popstars are branded today, where an entire company really is
behind everything.
...and then the lovely Kate Tunstall does this beautiful cover, love her ;)

The top joint of my thumb, index and little  fingers bend but not my ring or middle fingers. Cosmetic surgery to reverse the joint would be a bit too far! :) Maybe for those of us ring-finger-top-joint-reverse-bendically challenged we can try wearing a stiff finger glove ...

	"The Universe Song" by Eric Idle
Attention kids! Watch that potty mouth. The saying "bugger-all" in the last verse is a swear in UK English. Try replacing it with "none at all" or "not a speck", or come up with your own saying.

Introduction:
(spoken)

Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown
And things seem sad or tough
And people are useless, or obnoxious, or daft,
And you feel that you've had quite enough...

Verse 1:

[G7]Just re-
[C]member that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
revolving at nine-hundred miles an [G7]hour
and orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
a sun that is the source of all our [C]power.
Now the sun and you and me, and all the stars that we can see
Are [A7]moving a million miles a [F]day
In an [F7]outer spiral arm at forty [C]thousand miles an hour
of the [G7]galaxy we call the Milky [C]Way.

Verse 2:

[C]Our galaxy itself contains a hundred million stars,
it's a hundred thousand light-years side to [G7]side,
it bulges in the middle, sixty thousand light-years thick,
but out by us it's just three thousand light-years [C]wide.
We're thiry thousand light-years from galactic central point
We go [A7]'round every two hundred million [F]years,
and our [F7]galaxy itself is one of [C]millions of billions in this
A[G7]mazing and Expanding Uni[C]verse!

Verse 3:

[C]The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
in all of the directions it can [G7]whiz,
as fast as it can go, the speed of light, y'know,
twelve million miles a minute, and that's the [C]fastest speed there is,
So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
How a[A7]mazingly unlikely is your [F]birth,
And [F7]pray that there's intelligent life [C]somewhere up in space,
'Cause there's [G7]bugger-all down here on [C]Earth.

Verse 1:

Everybody [Dm]knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody [Bb]rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody [Dm]knows the war is over
Everybody [Bb]knows the good guys lost
Everybody [Gm]knows the fight was [A]fixed
The poor stay [C]poor, the rich get [Dm]rich
That's how it [Eb]goes
[A]Everybody [Dm]knows

Everybody [Dm]knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody [Bb]knows the captain lied
Everybody [Dm]got this broken feeling
like their [Bb]father or their dog just died
Everybody [Gm]talking to their [A]pockets
Everybody [C]wants a box of [Dm]choc'lates
And a long stem [Eb]rose
[A]Everybody [Dm]knows

Everybody [Dm]knows that you love me, baby
Everybody [Bb]knows that you really do
Everybody [Dm]knows that you've been faithful
[Bb]Give or take a night or two
Everybody [Gm]knows you've been dis[A]creet
But there were so many [C]people you just had to [Dm]meet
Without your [Eb]clothes
[A]And everybody [Dm]knows

Chorus:

Everybody [F]knows, everybody [C]knows

[Dm]And everybody [Dm]knows that it's now or never
Everybody [Bb]knows that's me or you
And everybody [Dm]knows that you live forever
When you've [Bb]done a line or two
Everybody [Gm]knows the deal is [A]rotten
Old black [C]Joe's still picking [Dm]cotton
For your ribbon and [Eb]bows
[A]And everybody [Dm]knows

Everybody [Dm]knows that the plague is coming
Everybody [Bb]knows that it's moving fast
Everybody [Dm]knows that the naked man and the woman
Are just a [Bb]shining artifact of the past
Everybody [Gm]knows the scene is [A]dead
But there's gonna [C]be a meter on your [Dm]bed
That will dis[Eb]close
[A]What everybody [Dm]knows

And everybody [Dm]knows that you're in trouble
Everybody [Bb]knows what you've been through
From the bloody [Dm]cross on top of Calvary
To the [Bb]beach of Malibu
Everybody [Gm]knows it's coming a[A]part
Take one [C]last look at this sacred [Dm]heart
Before it [Eb]blows
[A]And everybody [Dm]knows

	"Ring of Fire" by Johnny Cash

[G]Love is a [C]burning [G]thing
And it makes a [C]fiery [G]ring
Bound by [C]wild de[G]sire
I fell into a [C]ring of [G]fire

[D]I fell in to a [C]burning ring of [G]fire
I went [D]down, down, down
And the [C]flames went [G]higher

And it [G]burns, burns, burns
The [C]ring of [G]fire
The [C]ring of [G]fire

[G]The taste of [C]love is [G]sweet
When hearts like [C]ours [G]meet
I fell for you [C]like a [G]child
Oh but the [C]fire went [G]wild

[D]I fell in to a [C]burning ring of [G]fire
I went [D]down, down, down
And the [C]flames went [G]higher

And it [G]burns, burns, burns
The [C]ring of [G]fire
The [C]ring of [G]fire

[G]And it burns, burns, burns
The [C]ring of [G]fire
The [C]ring of [G]fire

She was a 	showgirl
 	Am7-5	D7
With yellow 	feathers in her 	hair

And a 	dress cut down to there
She would merengue
And do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
 	Cm	D7	Gm
Across the 	cro	wded	 floor
 	Cm	D7	Gm
They worked from e	ight t	il f	our

They were y	oung and they had each 	other

Who could 	ask 	for  	more

His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair
He saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished
He called her over
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew
And chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gunshot
But just who shot who?

Her name is Lola
She was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago
When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco
But not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
and she's lost her mind
