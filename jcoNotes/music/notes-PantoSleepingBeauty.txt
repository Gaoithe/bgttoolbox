 "Now I know where I belong..."

Now I know where to go,
I'm not following the crowd
But there's so many faces staring at me.
I'm not going with the flow,
I gotta wave goodbye and say hello,
To unfamiliar circumstances!

Oh oh oh,
I'm gonna start believin' in myself.
It's up to me and no-one else.
I'm feelin'!!

(Chorus)
This could be the start of something,
I can feel my heart is jumping.
Want to walk but can't stop running,
(Oooooo)I can't stop running!
Good to be a part of something,
Once upon a time was nothing.
This could be the start of something,
This could be the start of something good!

Life's a b****, life's a mess!
Try'na find your way it's not so easy,
It's not the way it looks on TV.
I'm fully clothed, but still undressed.
Like I'm walking on the highest wire,
Without a safety net below me!

Oh oh oh oh,
Ain't no other place I'd rather be,
Listen to the voice inside of me,
That's shoutin'!!

(Chorus:)
This could be the start of something,
I can feel my heart is jumping.

Good to be where I belong...
It's just so good to belon-on-on-ong...
Maybe this time is the one. (time is the one)
Maybe this time is the one time I've been waiting for too long!

With A Little Help From My Friends Lyrics
Artist(Band):The Beatles

What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm,I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, get high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, gonna to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm I get high with a little help from my friends,
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Ooh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
with a little help from my friends

TRACY 
You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill 
You can try to stop the seasons, girl, but you know you never will 
And you can try to stop my dancing feet, but I just cannot stand still! 
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of the sound 
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way 

TRACY & LINK 
'Cause you can't stop the beat 
Ever since this whole world began 
A woman found out if she shook it, she could shake up a man 
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that i can today 
'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky 
You can wonder, if you wanna, but I'll never ask why 
And if you try and hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say 
That you can't stop the beat! 

PENNY 
You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea 
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be! 
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed, I'll call the N double A C P 
Cause the world keeps spinnin round and round 
And my heart's keepin time to the speed of sound 
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way 

PENNY & SEAWEED 
Cause you cant stop the beat! 
Ever since we first saw the light 
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night 
and so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today 
Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean, or the rain from above 
you can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay 
Cause you cant stop the beat! 

EDNA 
You can't stop my happiness, cause I like the way I am 
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas Ham! 
So if you don't like the way I look, well, I just dont give a damn! 
Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
and my hearts keepin time to the speed of sound 
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way 
Cause you cant stop the beat 
Ever since this whole world began 
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man 
and so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today! 
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky 
You can wonder, if you wanna, but I'll never ask why 
And if you try and hold me down, I'm gonna spit in your eye and say 
That you can't stop the beat! 

MOTORMOUTH MAYBELLE 
Oh, Oh, Oh 
You can't stop today [No!] 
As it comes speeding down the track [oooh, child yes!] 
Yesterday is history [be gone!] 
And it's never comin back! [Look ahead, cause...] 
Tomorrow is a brand new day, and it don't know white from black [YEAH!] 
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
And my heart's keepin time to the speed of sound 
I was lost til I heard the drums, then I found my way 
'Cause you cant stop the beat! 
Ever since we first saw the light, 
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night 
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today! 
Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean, or the rain from above 
They can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay 
Cause you can't stop the beat! 

ENSEMBLE 
Aah, aah, aah, 
Ahh, ahh, ahh 
Ahh, ahh, ahh ahh 
Ever since we first saw the sun 
A man and woman like to shake it when the day is done 
And so we're gonna shake and shimmy it and have some fun today! 
Cause you can't stop the Motion of the ocean or the rain from above 
You can try to stop the paradise were dreamin of 
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay! 

You cant stop the beat! (you cant stop the beat) 
You cant stop the beat! (you cant stop the beat) 
YOU CANT STOP THE BEAT!

I'm So Excited - Pointer Sisters
1982

Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Get in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I let it go

I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know I know I know I know I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last for long long time
We'll have a good time, Baby, don't do worry
And if we're still playin' around boy that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I know I know I know I know I know I want you, I want you

I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I let it go

I'm so excited, I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I know I know I know I know I know I want you

Somewhere Out There
Lyrics as performed by
Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram
from the movie An American Tail (1987)
written by James Horner, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil

Linda:
Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight

james:
Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

Linda:
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Together:
Somewhere out there if love can see us through
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

[musical interlude]

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there if love can see us through
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

Kinks : Lola 
Songwriters: Davies, Raymond Douglas;
http://www.mp3lyrics.org/k/kinks/lola/

I met her in a club down in north Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes,
Just like cherry-cola [3] , cee-oh-el-aye, cola.
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice,
She said, "Lola. El-Oh-El-Aye, Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola."

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy,
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine,
Oh my, Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand,
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man.
Oh my, Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.

[Short Instrumental break.]

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight.
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said, "Dear boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my,
[ Find more Lyrics on http://mp3lyrics.org/14 ]
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.

I pushed her away. I walked to the door.
I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees.
Then I looked at her and she at me.

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay,
And I always want it to be that way for my,
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls,
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for,
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.

Well, I left home just a week before,
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before.
But, Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
And said, "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man."

Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man,
But I know what I am and in bed I'm a man, and so is,
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola, Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola.
[Fade.]

Joe Dolan You're Such a Good Looking Woman Lyrics:
When God created a woman for me
he must have been in a beautiful mood
to show the world what a woman could be
when he created a woman like you.
He made the sunshine right out of your eyes
he made the moonglow all over your hair
he put a soft summer breeze in your sighs
so you could breath summer into the air.

Up there in heaven I bet the are mad
I bet somebody will want to know why
the most incredible angel they had
was found to be quite unable to fly
[ Find more Lyrics on http://mp3lyrics.org/9Wt ]
D'you know what they had forgotten to do
up there where they make all those heavenly things
they made an angel as lovely as you
but they'd forgotten to fit you with wings.

R E F R A I N :

Oh me oh my you make me sigh
you're such a good looking woman
when people stop and people stare
you know it fills my heart with pride
you watch their eyes they're so surprised
they think you've fallen out of heaven
and if you listen to what they're talking about
they're talking about who's walking about
with an angel at his side.

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Hmm, hmm, hmm,...

I wanna see it tainted, tainted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it tainted, tainted, tainted, tainted black
Yeah!

Hmm, hmm, hmm,...

Uh-huh huh huh huh

VERSE 1:

Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby give me one more chance
(show you that I love you)

My baby's always dancin'
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
And from that night I kissed
Our love goodbye

CHORUS:
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on moonlight

VERSE:
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me
On my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me

Don't blame it on sunshine

That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me
Through this dance

I'm full of funky fever
And fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a
Super trance
