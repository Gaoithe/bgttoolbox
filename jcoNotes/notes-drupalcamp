Usability for non geeks.
Discussion in B&B and Alan Burke
Changes made on webserver.
If there's a theme + module that does what you want then interface is clicky-draggy.  If something goes wrong ... good logging/view into internals but this usable really only for more tech people.

me? IMHO proper coding process for websites: use of templates, seperate design and content is in place if you use Drupal.

Powerful but also complex.

Who?
* standard sites, community sites
* Private, member only, company intranet sites

0. hosting arrangement, domain name register
 this is tricky for non tech people
 what is your hosting interface
  how can you upload modules and themes? (even can you?)
    how do you develop - dev env on own laptop/pc
hosters + votes + reviews + advice by country (does country matter?)    


1. install
Also download modules (not enabled yet)
and unpackage

2. can't live without modules: Administration menu
 Wyzywig module enable
 IMCE (add images using wysywig)
  editor TinyMCE download and add seperately
 Administer -> Site Building -> Modules (enable ...)
 Administer -> Site Config -> configure wyzywig

3. create page/story
 story - date and who - good for news

• Imagefield 5.x-1.x-dev (2007-Feb-23)

• Views Bonus Pack 5.x-1.0
• Custom Pagers 5.x-1.7

create presets:
a. 'Square Thumbnail' – scale to 150 x 150 then crop to 75 x 75
b. 'Display' – scale to 650 x 650

5. Now create a View (admin/build/views). I called mine 'Image Gallery'. You just need a Page, not a Block. Choose 'gallery' for the Page URL (or whatever you want).

a. In the Page settings, choose the 'Bonus: Grid View' for the View Type. I used 24 nodes per page – shooting for a 6 wide by 4 tall grid (max size).

b. In the fields section add the fields 'Title' and 'Image' (your CCK image field created in 2 above).

How to integrate into text editors:
FCKeditor: Admin->Settings->Fckeditor profile->File browser settings->IMCE integration
TinyMCE with WYSIWYG API: Install IMCE Wysiwyg API bridge and enable IMCE in the plugin list of your wysiwyg profile.
TinyMCE: See http://drupal.org/node/241753#comment-792305


So install fckeditor module
 install fckeditor
 install wysywig module
  tinymce   or http://drupal.org/project/imce_wysiwyg
  imce







WOAH.  UNOUCH a bit:
Views Edit is not intuitive.

Read the Views Getting Started help.
http://localhost/drupal/?q=help/views/getting-started&popup=1


http://localhost/drupal/?q=admin/build/views/edit/gallery_view


http://drupalworx.com/node/80


To Add view
Goto Administer -> Site Building -> Views, click Add tab
http://localhost/drupal/?q=admin/build/views/add
This is obvious enough

Name image_gallery Desc Image Gallery type node
Also obvious enough (though node?)

Now. First thing, on the left click Add Display (of type Page is default in the select)
Then in Page settings set path to the URL "gallery"

 Live preview will show helpful warnings or errors e.g.:
    * Display "Defaults" uses fields but there are none defined for it or all are excluded.
    * Display "Page" uses fields but there are none defined for it or all are excluded.





"5. Now create a View (admin/build/views). I called mine 'Image Gallery'. You just need a Page, not a Block. Choose 'gallery' for the Page URL (or whatever you want).

a. In the Page settings, choose the 'Bonus: Grid View' for the View Type. I used 24 nodes per page – shooting for a 6 wide by 4 tall grid (max size).

b. In the fields section add the fields 'Title' and 'Image' (your CCK image field created in 2 above).

 enable IMCE ... bunch of other buttons

Feedback for Drupal


http://groups.drupal.org/node/21027#comment-72674



Feedback from a Drupal newbie developer's perspective.

Great weekend! Thanks loads to everyone especially the organisers for all the work put in. Not only were they organising the event but also were the key speakers! So well done!  And brilliant to meet such a nice friendly bunch or weird and wonderful people :)

The format was really good IMHO. Sometimes at a 'proper' conference you attend a really good talk and learn something but it can be a very passive experience and I've learned a ton of stuff at this event.

As an experienced developer (not in Drupal) the whole weekend gave a really good insight into good designs for sites and how Drupal site spec/design/implement process works.  You can only gain this stuff with experience and it is really valuable to get an insight there and have access to really excellent Drupal people. Also meeting some real end users and seeing some graphics/theme design was very interesting.

Saturday 

I stayed with the newbie track on Sat and absorbed a load of stuff.
There was a better defined structure in the "newbie" room and I found every presentation had elements of very good value. Where I already was familiar with what was going on I could tune out a little and try and catch up reading Drupal docs on some areas or work on my Drupal Install/Configure.

You can only really learn something properly by doing it fully yourself but seeing GalwayFLUX site overview and ShadowBox Theatre site created gives a huge jump start ~kindof~ background reassurance that what you're doing (especially with regard to Modules used) is sensible, stable, tried and trusted.   

It sounded like in the experienced track people didn't stay on topic long enough to get full satisfaction and feel they fully learned something or answered questions fully. Perhaps that is where a proper unconference/barcamp style works better? If the whole experienced/intermediate group tries to stay together you can only cover any issue lightly. If the experienced track was split up even more into smaller workshops which really delved into some one thing it could work. 


Sunday - website build

Sunday was very nice, fantastic atmosphere.
At the start (especially as a newbie) it wasn't possible to get involved.
We shoulder-surfed module config and development a bit.
Alan was very good setting up and then introducing what work was ongoing and delegating and  pulling people in when possible. 
It was good to be accidentally sitting in the middle of the design people working on the theme.  It would be nice for me to do the day again and pay attention to the design and see what was happening there.
Later on I just helped upload a bunch of images into the gallery. Very simple but nice as worked with Margaret from Zikomo who could explain what was going on and give them good titles which adds a great deal to the gallery.

What might make maximum use of this sort of event is if the project work was tracked and recorded and presented out loud while the work was happening.
The presenter (one person or one person for design/dev/content) would:
 * follow what was happening,
 * explain it aloud (as best they could) to the general group (people half paying attention could pay more attention for interesting things)
 * record issues or tasks ongoing/completed/new. (record on web or on whiteboard)
Doing this could be a bit distracting for the work (especially if the explaination is wrong! :)).
You might feel like a bit of an eejit. :-P
It is probably hard to do this.
But I think this approach could reveal what was happening in general and even allow for enhanced synergistic intra-team communication :).  


Finally thanks again for such a good event.
There was loads going on and I felt it would have been handy if I could aplit myself in at least 2.
Tons of activity and material and ideas so I definately am looking forward to future events.
